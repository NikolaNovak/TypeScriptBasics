# TypeScriptBasics

Learning TypeScript basics.

TS files can be compiled into JS files with the following command:

> tsc <file_name>

TS watch mode (automatic compilation on file save) can be started with:

> tsc <file_name> -w

To configure the TS compiler run the following command (whilst located in the project directory):

> tsc --init

After running the previous command all files in the current project can be compiled with (watch mode for all files works as well):

> tsc

This project is supported by lite-server which can be started with the following command:
